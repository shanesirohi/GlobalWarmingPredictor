# GlobalWarmingPredictor
I created this project for people to understand how scary our life could be if we do not manage our resources and amenities carefully. 
I have used python's qt5 , matplotlib and sklearn module to predict data for the year *entered by the user*. It generates graphs and presentable gui. 


It is open source so any one can use it, just add the LICENSE file and you can use it anywhere you wish.
